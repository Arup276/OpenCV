# OpenCV
openCV -python is a python library use for solving computer vision problem.

# Here we created a motion detector which will detect the objects came front of the camera and add a rectangular box around it.

# How it's work?
its simple.
Step1: First it take the first frame and save it .

Step2: Calculate the absolute difference between the first frame and next other frames(If difference is found means that their is a object).

Step3: Set a threshold value so that less than 30 pixel value will black and greater than 30 pixels will be white.

Step4: Create rectangular boxs where the object is detected.

Thats all.
